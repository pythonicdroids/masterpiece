### Mission 03

- Have a L shaped bar, have it lifted up and to complete the mission move it down once we are at the mission

- Have 2 forks on the side that lift up at the same time, moving the sides up and completing the mission

### Mission 06

#### 6.1 Sound

- Have a long stick with axle connected to a gear, the gear in question attaches to one of the speaker gears as we do mission 7.


#### 6.2 Lights

- Have a long L-shaped pole that moves down on to the orange thing for the mission, and have it keep moving down as we drive into it. it eventually flings up completing the mission

- The pole will be the same as mission 3 but longer

### Mission 7

- Have a mechanical alligner and push, once the thing is pushed do missions 6.1 and 6.2


- The alligner will be 2 slanted bars on either side of the robot, and the space in the middle will be exactly the width of the mission
